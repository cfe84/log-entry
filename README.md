Create entries for your work log (or diary). 
Mainly used to capture current time into the filename and template.

# Usage

Log entry adds one command to the palette called "Create log entry". It creates a file with a template using the current date.

Template, file name and default path can be configured in the settings. It uses moment.js to process date, so look at [its documentation](https://momentjs.com/) to understand how to change the format.
